**Based on prior research, I anticipate that gestational weeks, maternal
race, and maternal smoking are each associated with birthweight. I
additionally conducted a regression model with all predictors, and
included those that were found to be significant at p \< .10,
two-tailed. Thus, my final predictor variables included: (1) baby sex,
(2) baby head circumference, (3) baby length, (4) maternal weight at
delivery, and (5) parity, as well as (6) gestational weeks, (7) maternal
race, and (8) maternal smoking.**

**From this plot, it is apparent that the model including only length at
birth and gestational age is the worst fitting model. My model has the
lowest cross-validated prediction error, and is therefor the preferred
model, however, the model including head circumference, length, sex, and
all two- and three-way interactions also performs decently well.**

> Problem 3

> For this problem, we’ll use the 2017 Central Park weather data that

weather\_df = rnoaa::meteo\_pull\_monitors( c(“USW00094728”), var =
c(“PRCP”, “TMIN”, “TMAX”), date\_min = “2017-01-01”, date\_max =

select(name, id, everything()) The boostrap is helpful when you’d like
to perform inference for a parameter / value / summary that doesn’t have
an easy-to-write-down distribution in the usual repeated sampling
framework. We’ll focus on a simple linear regression with tmax as the
response and tmin as the predictor, and are interested in the
distribution of two quantities estimated from these data:

r<sup>2 log(β</sup>0∗β^1) Use 5000 bootstrap samples and, for each
bootstrap sample, produce estimates of these two quantities. Plot the
distribution of your estimates, and describe these in words. Using the
5000 bootstrap estimates, identify the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles to
provide a 95% confidence interval for r^2 and log(β<sup>0∗β</sup>1).
Note: broom::glance() is helpful for extracting r^2 from a fitted
regression, and broom::tidy() (with some additional wrangling) should
help in computing log(β<sup>0∗β</sup>1).
