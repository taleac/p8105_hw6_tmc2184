> Problem 1

> Create a city\_state variable (e.g. “Baltimore, MD”), and a binary
> variable indicating whether the homicide is solved. Omit cities
> Dallas, TX; Phoenix, AZ; and Kansas City, MO – these don’t report
> victim race. Also omit Tulsa, AL – this is a data entry mistake. For
> this problem, limit your analysis those for whom victim\_race is white
> or black. Be sure that victim\_age is numeric.

> Problem 2

> In this problem, you will analyze data gathered to understand the
> effects of several variables on a child’s birthweight. This dataset,
> available here, consists of roughly 4000 children and includes the
> following variables:

babysex: baby’s sex (male = 1, female = 2) bhead: baby’s head
circumference at birth (centimeters) blength: baby’s length at birth
(centimeteres) bwt: baby’s birth weight (grams) delwt: mother’s weight
at delivery (pounds) fincome: family monthly income (in hundreds,
rounded) frace: father’s race (1 = White, 2 = Black, 3 = Asian, 4 =
Puerto Rican, 8 = Other, 9 = Unknown) gaweeks: gestational age in weeks
malform: presence of malformations that could affect weight (0 = absent,
1 = present) menarche: mother’s age at menarche (years) mheigth:
mother’s height (inches) momage: mother’s age at delivery (years)
mrace: mother’s race (1 = White, 2 = Black, 3 = Asian, 4 = Puerto Rican,
8 = Other) parity: number of live births prior to this pregnancy
pnumlbw: previous number of low birth weight babies pnumgsa: number of
prior small for gestational age babies ppbmi: mother’s pre-pregnancy BMI
ppwt: mother’s pre-pregnancy weight (pounds) smoken: average number of
cigarettes smoked per day during pregnancy wtgain: mother’s weight gain
during pregnancy (pounds) Load and clean the data for regression
analysis (i.e. convert numeric to factor where appropriate, check for
missing data, etc.).

Propose a regression model for birthweight. This model may be based on a
hypothesized structure for the factors that underly birthweight, on a
data-driven model-building process, or a combination of the two.
Describe your modeling process and show a plot of model residuals
against fitted values – use add\_predictions and add\_residuals in
making this plot.

Compare your model to two others:

One using length at birth and gestational age as predictors (main
effects only) One using head circumference, length, sex, and all
interactions (including the three-way interaction) between these Make
this comparison in terms of the cross-validated prediction error; use
crossv\_mc and functions in purrr as appropriate.

Note that although we expect your model to be reasonable, model building
itself is not a main idea of the course and we don’t necessarily expect
your model to be “optimal”.

Problem 3 For this problem, we’ll use the 2017 Central Park weather data
that we’ve seen elsewhere. The code chunk below (adapted from the course
website) will download these data.

weather\_df = rnoaa::meteo\_pull\_monitors( c(“USW00094728”), var =
c(“PRCP”, “TMIN”, “TMAX”), date\_min = “2017-01-01”, date\_max =
“2017-12-31”) %\>% mutate( name = recode(id, USW00094728 =
“CentralPark\_NY”), tmin = tmin / 10, tmax = tmax / 10) %\>%
select(name, id, everything()) The boostrap is helpful when you’d like
to perform inference for a parameter / value / summary that doesn’t have
an easy-to-write-down distribution in the usual repeated sampling
framework. We’ll focus on a simple linear regression with tmax as the
response and tmin as the predictor, and are interested in the
distribution of two quantities estimated from these data:

r<sup>2 log(β</sup>0∗β^1) Use 5000 bootstrap samples and, for each
bootstrap sample, produce estimates of these two quantities. Plot the
distribution of your estimates, and describe these in words. Using the
5000 bootstrap estimates, identify the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles to
provide a 95% confidence interval for r^2 and log(β<sup>0∗β</sup>1).
Note: broom::glance() is helpful for extracting r^2 from a fitted
regression, and broom::tidy() (with some additional wrangling) should
help in computing log(β<sup>0∗β</sup>1).
